//Write a function, nonsense that takes an input string. This function contains another function, blab which alerts string and is immediately called inside the function nonsense. blab should look like this inside of the nonsense function:

// In your function, nonsense, change the immediate call to a setTimeout so that the call to blab comes after 2 seconds. The blab function itself should stay the same as before.

var nonsense = function(string){
	var blab = function()}{
		alert(string);
	};
	blab();
};
